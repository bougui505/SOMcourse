    \begin{itemize}
        \item SOM stand for \textbf{Self-Organizing Map} and was first described by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen.
        \item A SOM is an \textbf{artificial neural network} that is trained using an \textbf{unsupervised learning} process.
        \item The \textbf{dimension of the SOM} ($X \times Y$) is chosen by the user (only 2D SOM will be aborded).
        \item Mathematically, a 2D-SOM is a \textbf{3D-matrix} of dimension ($X \times Y \times n$) with $n$ the dimension of the input space.
        \item A \textbf{neuron} is a cell characterized by its position $(i,j)$ in the ($X \times Y$) plane of the SOM. Its dimension is $n$.
    \end{itemize}
