        \footnotesize
        A script called \texttt{makeVectorsFromdcd\_PCA.py} in \texttt{application} does the job.
    \begin{lstlisting}
python makeVectorsFromdcd_PCA.py makeVectorsFromdcd_PCA.conf
    \end{lstlisting}
with \texttt{makeVectorsFromdcd\_PCA.conf}:
    \begin{lstlisting}
[makeVectors]
nframes: 9249 # Number of frames in the dcd file
structFile: 2pgb_hydro_ca.pdb
trajFile: newtraj78_210521_ca.dcd
projection: True
nProcess: 4 # Number of parallel process
    \end{lstlisting}
    The script creates 5 files:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{eigenValues.npy}: contains the eigenvalues of the distance matrix.
        \item \texttt{eigenVectorsList.npy}: contains the eigenvectors.
        \item \texttt{meansList.npy}: contains the means over the lines of the distance matrix.
        \item \texttt{projections.npy}: contains the projections of the distance matrix on the first four eigenvectors (this is the file which will be used for the SOM training process).
        \item \texttt{reconstruction.npy}: contains the concatenation of the eigenvectors, means and projections, which is useful when one want to reconstruct structure from the descriptor.
    \end{itemize}
