    \begin{description}
        \item[Map size] A map size \textbf{$50 \times 50$} is convenient to visualize the U-matrix and large enough to cluster large dataset.
        \item[Number of iterations] Splited in \textbf{two phases}. The number of iterations is equal to the number of input data for the first phase and twice this number for the second phase.
        \item[Learning rate] Starting from \textbf{0.5} and ending to \textbf{0.25} for the first phase and starting from \textbf{0.25} and ending to \textbf{0.0} for the second phase.
        \item[Radius] Starting from \textbf{6.25} and ending to \textbf{3.0} for the first phase and starting from \textbf{4.0} and ending to \textbf{1.0} for the second phase.
